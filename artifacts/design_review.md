### Visual Inconsistencies

1. **Header Text:**
   - Code: "Welcome to Your Onboarding Journey"
   - Image: "Welcome to Your Oour Onboarding Journey"

2. **Font Size and Style:**
   - Code does not specify font size or style for button text and headers, while the design shows specific styling.

3. **Button Style:**
   - Code: `StyledButton` with text underline or filled buttons.
   - Image: Rounded buttons with different background colors and position.

4. **Progress Bar:**
   - Code: Simple progress bar with text "Progress Bar".
   - Image: Progress bar is labeled, and the progress value is displayed as text within the bar.

5. **Layout:**
   - Code uses `flex` for layout, but the design has distinct spacing and potentially different alignment.

6. **Task List Text:**
   - Code: "Essential Info", "Document Upload", and "Additions".
   - Image: Different task list items with specific checks and styles.

7. **Icons Usage:**
   - Code uses `material-icons`, but the design includes custom icons not specified in the code.

8. **Side Screen Headings:**
   - Code: "Simidities" and "Prof Hies".
   - Image: Slightly different headings and arrangement.

9. **Background and Padding:**
   - Code: Simple backgrounds.
   - Image: Custom designed background with specific padding.

10. **Subtitle Text:**
    - Code: Generic placeholders.
    - Image: Specific instructional or descriptive text.

11. **Dot Indicators:**
    - Code: Three gray dots of uniform color.
    - Image: Specific design and color scheme for indicators.

### Conclusion

The rendered output from the code would not match visually with the provided design image due to differences in text content, button styles, layout arrangements, and additional design elements present in the image.
