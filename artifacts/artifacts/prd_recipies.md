## 2. The Problem

**2.1. Problem Statement:**
Many people struggle with meal planning and making the best use of the ingredients they already have at home. Busy professionals lack time to plan meals or shop for missing ingredients, college students are challenged by budget constraints and limited pantry items, and family caregivers must juggle dietary needs, allergies, and portion sizes for multiple people. This often results in food waste, unplanned purchases, and mealtime stress.

**2.2. User Personas & Scenarios:**

- **Persona 1: Busy Professional**
    - *Scenario:* Samantha, a consultant, comes home late and wants to prepare a quick meal without making an extra trip to the store. She needs a way to quickly check what ingredients she has and get recipe suggestions that match her available time and dietary preferences.

- **Persona 2: College Student**
    - *Scenario:* Alex is a college student with a limited budget and a sparse pantry. He wants to find creative, low-cost meals using just a few common ingredients, and appreciates being shown substitutions for items he doesn’t have.

- **Persona 3: Family Caregiver**
    - *Scenario:* Priya is a parent managing meals for a family of four, including a child with a nut allergy. She wants to plan weekly meals, track pantry inventory, receive expiration reminders, filter out allergen-containing recipes, and generate efficient shopping lists to minimize store trips.
