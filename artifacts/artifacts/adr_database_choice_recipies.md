# Architectural Decision: Use of sqlite3, Tavilly, FastAPI, and GPT-4.1 for Recipe Suggestion Tool

**Status:** Accepted

## Context

We are building a recipe suggestion tool that requires robust natural language processing for user queries, efficient storage and retrieval of recipes and user data, and a modern web API interface. The primary priorities are rapid prototyping, low operational overhead, ease of integration with Python, and support for semantic search and conversational user experience. The anticipated usage is moderate (not high-concurrency or enterprise scale) and the goal is to validate product-market fit before considering scale-out solutions.

Key concerns influencing this decision:
- **Resource constraints:** Limited infrastructure and DevOps resources; speed of development is critical.
- **Integration:** Preference for Python-based, modern, and actively maintained tools.
- **Functionality:** Need for semantic search, conversational AI, and a performant web API.
- **Cost:** Minimize expenses during early development and prototyping.
- **Scalability:** Willing to trade off some scalability for simplicity at this stage.

## Decision

After evaluating alternatives, we have decided to use the following technologies as the core of our architecture:

- **sqlite3** as the primary data store for recipes, users, and related metadata.
- **Tavilly** as the search engine for semantic and hybrid search capabilities.
- **FastAPI** as the web API framework for exposing endpoints and integrating services.
- **GPT-4.1** (via OpenAI API) as the LLM for handling recipe suggestion, NLP tasks, and conversational UX.

**Justification:**

- **sqlite3** is a lightweight, serverless, zero-cost database embedded in Python, ideal for rapid prototyping and small/medium projects. It requires minimal setup and is perfectly suited for our low-concurrency, early-stage environment.
    - *Alternatives (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.)* are more robust but introduce unnecessary operational overhead for our current needs.

- **Tavilly** provides semantic search capabilities with simple Python integration, is open-source and free, and is easy to self-host. Its vector search features match our need for natural language and hybrid search functionality.
    - *Alternatives (Elasticsearch, Typesense, etc.)* are more feature-rich but are heavier to deploy, require more resources, and may be overkill for our initial scale.

- **FastAPI** offers async support, high performance, automatic OpenAPI docs, and strong Python type hinting, making it a great fit for a modern, maintainable API layer with low boilerplate.
    - *Alternatives (Flask, Django, etc.)* are either synchronous (limiting performance) or more opinionated/heavyweight than required for our needs.

- **GPT-4.1** is the state-of-the-art in language models, offering excellent conversational ability and understanding for recipe suggestions and related NLP tasks. Its robust APIs and documentation reduce integration risk.
    - *Alternatives (open-source LLMs, smaller models)* can be cheaper and self-hosted, but would require more infrastructure and likely provide less accurate results at this stage. GPT-4.1â€™s superior performance and ease of use outweigh its cost for early development.

## Consequences

**Positive Outcomes:**
- Rapid setup and prototyping with minimal infrastructure and configuration.
- Low operational and maintenance overhead during early stages.
- Modern, high-quality user experience with strong NLP and semantic search.
- Easy integration between components, all Python-friendly.
- Cost-effective: no server/database hosting fees, and open-source search engine.

**Negative Outcomes:**
- **Scalability Limitations:** sqlite3 and Tavilly are not ideal for high-concurrency or large-scale, multi-user systems; future migration to more robust solutions may be required.
- **Feature Limits:** Tavilly has a smaller community and fewer advanced features compared to mature search engines.
- **GPT-4.1 API Costs:** Usage costs can increase with scale, and reliance on a 3rd-party API introduces latency and potential for outages.
- **Future Migration:** If project grows, migration to PostgreSQL (or similar) and a more scalable search backend would be necessary, incurring technical debt.

**Follow-up Actions:**
- Monitor usage and performance; reevaluate architecture if user base or data volume grows significantly.
- Keep schema and interfaces modular to ease future migrations.
- Document data models and integration points to support potential technology swaps in the future.
