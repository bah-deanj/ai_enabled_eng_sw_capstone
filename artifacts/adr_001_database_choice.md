# Architectural Decision Record: Use PostgreSQL with pgvector

## Status
Accepted

## Context

The new hire onboarding tool requires storing and searching vector embeddings to enable semantic search and personalized recommendations. The primary backend options considered for this purpose were:

1. **PostgreSQL with the pgvector extension:** Enhances PostgreSQL to support vector datatypes and similarity search, allowing embeddings to be stored and queried alongside traditional relational data.
2. **Specialized vector databases** (such as ChromaDB, FAISS, Pinecone, Milvus): Purpose-built for efficient, large-scale vector search and related ML-centric features.

Key contextual factors influencing this decision include:

- The current infrastructure already uses PostgreSQL as the primary database.
- The expected scale of embeddings and query volume is moderate, aligning with an initial rollout or proof-of-concept rather than immediate large-scale production.
- Operational simplicity and ease of integration are prioritized to accelerate time-to-market.
- The engineering team has strong familiarity with PostgreSQL and its ecosystem.
- Cost control is important, especially in early development stages.

## Decision

We will **use PostgreSQL with the pgvector extension** as the backend for storing and searching vector embeddings in the new hire onboarding tool.

- Embeddings will be stored as vector columns in existing or new PostgreSQL tables.
- pgvector will enable similarity search (e.g., nearest neighbor queries) directly in SQL, allowing easy integration with existing user and onboarding data.
- This approach leverages our existing database infrastructure, tools, and operational workflows.

## Consequences

**Positive Effects:**

- **Simplicity and Speed:** Single database to operate, reducing the number of moving parts and accelerating development.
- **Integration:** Vector search can be combined with relational queries (e.g., filtering or joining with user metadata) using familiar SQL constructs.
- **Cost Efficiency:** No additional infrastructure cost or devops overhead, as PostgreSQL is already in use.
- **Maturity and Reliability:** PostgreSQL is a stable, ACID-compliant database with strong backup, monitoring, and tooling support.

**Negative Effects:**

- **Performance Limitations:** At scale (millions of vectors, high query throughput), vector search performance may not match that of specialized vector databases. Latency and throughput may become bottlenecks.
- **Scalability Constraints:** PostgreSQL is less suited for distributed, large-scale vector workloads. Scaling may require vertical scaling or basic sharding, which can be limiting.
- **Feature Gaps:** Lacks some advanced vector search features (e.g., hybrid search, advanced filtering, custom re-ranking) available in dedicated vector DBs.

**Follow-up Actions:**

- **Monitor Usage and Performance:** If embedding storage or query volume grows significantly, or advanced features are required, reevaluate adoption of a specialized vector database.
- **Stay Updated:** Monitor pgvector and PostgreSQL feature evolution for improvements in performance and capabilities.
- **Document Limitations:** Clearly document the limitations and potential migration paths for future scale.

---

**In summary:**  
PostgreSQL with pgvector is the optimal choice for the current onboarding toolâ€™s needs, balancing ease of integration, operational simplicity, cost, and sufficient performance for the initial scale. This approach allows rapid prototyping and iteration, with a clear migration path to more specialized vector search infrastructure if future requirements demand it.
