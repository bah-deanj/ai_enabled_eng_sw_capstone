Many home cooks have recipes scattered across various formats—bookmarks, photos, and handwritten notes—making them difficult to find and manage.

**2.2. User Personas & Scenarios:**

- **Persona 1: The Organizer**
    - *Scenario:* David has a large collection of family recipes on paper cards and wants to digitize them to preserve them and access them easily from his phone or computer.

- **Persona 2: The Explorer**
    - *Scenario:* Maria enjoys trying new dishes and is looking for a simple platform to browse recipes created by other home cooks for inspiration.
